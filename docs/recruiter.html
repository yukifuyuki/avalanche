Here are the steps I follow to recruit. You can follow it or do your own thing, whatever gets results.</p><ol><li>Go to <code>Player Search</code> and search for first name "A"</li><li>Right click a person without a FC</li><li>Click <code>Send Tell</code></li><li>Press the tell macro (I put it on a hotbar)</li><li>Repeat from step 2 with the next person in the search results</li><li>Repeat from step 1 searching for first name "B", "C", "D", etc.</li></ol><p>Keep an eye out for replies while this is going on. Turning on sound notifications for receiving tells can help. If they are interested, search them up again in <code>Player Search</code> and click <code>Invite to Company</code>. You can finish sending tells to your current search results so that you don't lose track of where you are up to (ie. finish the current letter of the alphabet you're on before making a new search to send invites).</p><p>Once a certain number of people have joined up, let them know about the Discord <code>discord.gg/DXN3rkV</code> or this website if they don't use Discord.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>Sending out all the tells should take around 30 minutes, after that it would be good to wait another 30 minutes in the open world for late replies. You can craft or gather or anything that doesn't require you to go into an instance during this time.</p><p>It would be good to do this during peak hours to reach the maximum number of people. What exact time that would be is up to you.</p><h3>Tell Macro</h3><p>You can use it as it is or change it up. I have the <code>Hello!</code> auto-translated.</p><p><code>Hello! Do you need a FC? We are a casual fc with both new and old players from all over the world. You can engage as much or as little as you want (sorry if I've sent this before)</code></p><h3>Party Finder</h3><p>You can also put up a party finder at the same time as sending the tells.</p><p>Important settings are: <code>Limit Recruiting to World Server</code>, <code>Beginners/first-timers welcome</code>, and the <code>Comment</code>:</p><p><code>Casual FC Avalanche LF&gt;Friendly players to join our ranks. New players especially welcome! Send a tell!</code></p><img src="/avalanche/images/recruiter.png" alt="Party Finder"></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p>Join the Discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/DXN3rkV">https://discord.gg/DXN3rkV</a></p></div></footer><script src="/avalanche/common/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/avalanche/common/bootstrap-4.5.3-dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
