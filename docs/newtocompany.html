Introduce yourself, talk to people, and make friends. If you need help or just want people to play with, then speak up and take the initiative! If you keep quiet then you'll mostly be left alone...</p><p>We highly recommended you to <a href="https://discord.gg/DXN3rkV">join our Discord server</a> so you can get notified about company events and stay in touch with people outside of the game. Alternatively you can also check this website every so often to find out about any company events.</p><p>Find more about about our company here:</p><p><a href="rules">Company rules</a></p><p><a href="ranks">Company ranks</a></p><h3>New to Eorzea?</h3><p><b>MSQ</b></p><p>If you are new to the game, we recommend that you focus on the main story quests (MSQ) initially. Almost all the content in this game are locked behind progressing in the MSQ. Although it will be mostly a solo experience until you catch up, it is the quickest way to unlock everything you need to play with everyone else!</p><p>Of course, you can still chat with everyone while you are playing through the MSQ, and always feel free to ask for help with anything (especially those DPS queues!)</p><p><b>Job Quests</b></p><p>You should also keep up with your class/job quests. There are skills locked behind the class/job quests which you will need. There is only one quest every 3-5 levels so they are easy to complete. The class/job quests are also displayed in the Scenario Guide UI.</p><p><b>Gear</b></p><p>You should get a new set of gear at levels 50, 60, 70, and 80. There is quite a large jump in power at these levels as these were the level caps at some point in time.</p><p>You can get the highest item level gear with <code>Allagan Tomestones of Poetics</code> for levels 50, 60, and 70 from various cities and hubs. At level 80 it is more complicated as it is the current level cap. A full set of item level 480 gear can be crafted for under 300k gil, feel free to ask if you would like a set made for you.</p><table class="table table-striped table-sm" style="text-align:center"><tbody><tr><td>Level <b>49</b> max item level: <b>49</b></td><td>Level <b>50</b> max item level: <b>130</b></td></tr><tr><td>Level <b>59</b> max item level: <b>148</b></td><td>Level <b>60</b> max item level: <b>270</b></td></tr><tr><td>Level <b>69</b> max item level: <b>288</b></td><td>Level <b>70</b> max item level: <b>400</b></td></tr><tr><td>Level <b>79</b> max item level: <b>418</b></td><td>Level <b>80</b> max item level: <b>530</b></td></tr></tbody></table></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p>Join the Discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/DXN3rkV">https://discord.gg/DXN3rkV</a></p></div></footer><script src="/avalanche/common/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/avalanche/common/bootstrap-4.5.3-dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
